# Analyze Syslog Data in Real Time with ksqlDB

### Collecting ```sshd``` syslog events
If your Docker host is publicly facing and allows SSH connections from anywhere, a fun exercise can be to see who's trying to hack your host.

The Syslog connector is listening on port 5140/UDP.
- If your host is running rsyslog, add the following to /etc/rsyslog.conf:

  ```* @localhost:5140```

- Then restart rsyslog with:

  ```sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart```

- Create a stream from the syslog data with the following ksqlDB query:

  ```CREATE STREAM SYSLOG_STREAM WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='syslog', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');```

### To find attackers enumerating user accounts via ssh
Note: if also analyzing the included Syslog pcap, omit ```clonehost*``` hosts that were used to generate syslog data.

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMP, 
TAG, MESSAGE, HOST, REMOTEADDRESS AS DEST_IP,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP(FROM_UNIXTIME(TIMESTAMP), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') AS EVENT_TIME, 
REGEXP_EXTRACT('Invalid user (.*) from', MESSAGE, 1) AS USER,
REGEXP_EXTRACT('Invalid user .* from (.*) port', MESSAGE, 1) AS SRC_IP,
GETGEOFORIP(REGEXP_EXTRACT('Invalid user .* from (.*) port', MESSAGE, 1)) AS GEOIP,
GETASNFORIP(REGEXP_EXTRACT('Invalid user .* from (.*) port', MESSAGE, 1)) AS ASNIP
FROM  SYSLOG_STREAM WHERE TAG='sshd' AND MESSAGE LIKE 'Invalid user%' AND  HOST NOT LIKE 'clonehost%'
