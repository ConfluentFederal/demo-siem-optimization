# Optimize SIEM With Confluent

Confluent can optimize your SIEM solution by addressing three main factors:
- **Scale**: Capture and curate data at wire speed and petabyte scale across distributed environments that conventional ingest approaches cannot keep up with
- **Speed**: Detect, filter and enrich data to deliver real-time situational awareness, reduce false positives and respond to incident and threats faster
- **Cost**: Avoid vendor lock-in from expensive proprietary tools and utilize a tiered data model to minimize software and infrastructure costs
